      <p>
        Hello! My name is Kyle Pollich, and I am a fullstack developer located
        in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I graduated from Millersville University in
        2015 with a degree in Computer Science. I work mostly with JavaScript on
        anything from static marketing sites to serverless GraphQL APIs. I'm
        also a hobby programmer, and I love dabbling in new technology when I
        can. Recently, I've been getting my feet wet with Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I love playing guitar and drums. I'm also a big fan of
        League of Legends and other esports titles like Counter Strike. I've
        been married to my beautiful wife Alex since 2017, and we have two
        ridiculous bengals named Sterling and Stormy.
