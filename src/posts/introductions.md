Hello! My name is Kyle Pollich. I'm a web developer and software engineer from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I am 22 years old, and I'm a recent graduate of Millersville University's computer science program. I've been working for Clipper Magazine in Mountville, PA since May of 2015, and I recently accepted a position as Lead Backend Developer there.

In my day job, I work in a .NET/C# stack as well in Node.js for some API's and smaller projects. I am actively working on learning some other web technologies like Ruby on Rails, React, Android and more.

My posts will most likely not be highly technical in nature, as I tend to write more about philosophical and narrative topics concerning software development, the workplace, etc. Thanks for reading and I look forward to writing some more posts here.
