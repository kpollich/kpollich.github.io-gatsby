## About

I am a full stack web developer and software engineer from Lancaster, PA. I am passionate about programming as a career and as a hobby. I love solving problems, architecting solutions, and writing clean, expressive code. I love working in JavaScript and Ruby, but I strongly believe that there is a right tool for any development job, so I try not to hold any allegiances to a particular programming language or technology stack.
